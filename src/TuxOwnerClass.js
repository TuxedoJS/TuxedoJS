//createOwnerClass FUNCTION: creates an owner Tux Class which is a type of React class designed to manage application state, interact with stores, manage route params, and pass props into its ownee components
//@param ownerClassProps OBJECT: properties that the new ownerClass will possess, should be a standard React.createClass object with properties such as componentWillMount, componentDidMount, etc.  Please see http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html for a full list of React props
  //required keys:
  // render FUNCTION: since this is an implementation of React.createClass a render method is required
  //additional keys
    //connectOwnerToStore OBJECT: TuxStore for which actions will be registered [ALTERNATE ARRAY: array of objects with same keys as listed below]
      //expected keys:
      // store OBJECT: store object that the event and listener should be attached to
      // listener FUNCTION: callback function to be invoked upon associated event [ALTERNATE ARRAY: array of callback functions]
      // event STRING: event type to trigger listener callback function [ALTERNATE ARRAY: array of event type strings]
